#Carly wants to be able to market her low prices. We want to find out what the average price of a cut is. First, let’s sum up all the prices of haircuts. Create a variable total_price, and set it to 0.

total_price = 0

#Loop through the prices list and add each price to the variable total_price.
for price in prices:
  total_price += price

#After your loop, create a variable called average_price that is the total_price divided by the number of prices.You can get the number of prices by using the len() function

average_price = total_price / len(prices)

print("Avereage Haircut Price: " + str(average_price))

#That average price is more expensive than Carly thought it would be! She wants to cut all prices by 5 dollars. Use a list comprehension to make a list called new_prices, which has each element in prices minus 5.

new_prices = [price - 5 for price in prices]
print(new_prices)

#Carly really wants to make sure that Carly’s Clippers is a profitable endeavor. She first wants to know how much revenue was brought in last week.

total_revenue = 0

#Use a for loop to create a variable i that goes from 0 to len(hairstyles) Hint: You can use range() to do this!

for i in range(len(hairstyles)):
  #Add the product of prices[i] (the price of the haircut at position i) and last_week[i] (the number of people who got the haircut at position i) to total_revenue at each step.
  total_revenue += prices[i] * last_week[i]

  print("Total Revenue: " + str(total_revenue))

#Find the average daily revenue by dividing total_revenue by 7. Call this number average_daily_revenue and print it out
average_daily_revenue = total_revenue / 7


#Carly thinks she can bring in more customers by advertising all of the haircuts she has that are under 30 dollars.Use a list comprehension to create a list called cuts_under_30 that has the entry hairstyles[i] for each i for which new_prices[i] is less than 30.
 
cuts_under_30 = [ new_prices[i] for i in range(len(new_prices)) if new_prices[i] < 30]
